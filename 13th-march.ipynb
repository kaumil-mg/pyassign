    "Q1. Assumptions for ANOVA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normality**: The dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed within each group. Violations could occur if the data significantly deviate from normality, affecting the accuracy of ANOVA results.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Homogeneity of Variance**: The variances of the groups should be approximately equal. Violations, known as heteroscedasticity, can lead to inflated Type I error rates, impacting the validity of ANOVA results.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Independence**: Observations within each group should be independent of each other. Violations, such as autocorrelation or dependence among observations, can bias ANOVA results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of violations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normality: Skewed or heavily-tailed distributions, outliers.\n",
    "- Homogeneity of Variance: Unequal variances across groups, evident from visual inspection or Levene's test.\n",
    "- Independence: Data collected from the same subjects over time, violating the assumption of independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Types of ANOVA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-way ANOVA**: Compares means across two or more independent groups. Useful when comparing the effects of a single factor or treatment.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Two-way ANOVA**: Examines the influence of two independent categorical variables on a continuous dependent variable. Useful for studying interactions between factors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Repeated measures ANOVA**: Analyzes data where the same subjects are measured multiple times under different conditions. Useful for within-subject designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Partitioning of Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "In ANOVA, the total variance in the dependent variable is partitioned into components: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total sum of squares (SST)**: Variation in the dependent variable across all observations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Explained sum of squares (SSE)**: Variation explained by the factors or treatments.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Residual sum of squares (SSR)**: Unexplained variation or error within groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this concept helps in assessing how much of the total variance is accounted for by the factors being studied, aiding in the interpretation of ANOVA results.\n",
