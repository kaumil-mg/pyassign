    "Abstraction in OOPs refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from its external users and only showing the essential features or functionality that are relevant to the user. It allows us to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it.\n",

We do not need to know how the engine, transmission, and other complex systems work under the hood. This is an example of abstraction, where the car's internal implementation is hidden, and only its essential functionality is exposed to the user."
