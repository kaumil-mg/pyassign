    "Q1: Explain the following with an example:\n",
    "- Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "  Artificial Intelligence involves creating intelligent machines that can mimic human behavior and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. An example of AI is virtual personal assistants like Siri or Alexa, which use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "  Machine Learning focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. An example of ML is email spam detection, where the algorithm learns from labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails to classify new emails as either spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep Learning (DL):\n",
    "  Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns from data. An example of DL is image recognition, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained on a large dataset of images to accurately classify objects within those images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "   Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data, which includes both input features and corresponding target labels. The goal is to learn a mapping function from the input to the output. Examples of supervised learning include:\n",
    "   - Linear regression\n",
    "   - Logistic regression\n",
    "   - Decision trees\n",
    "   - Random forests\n",
    "   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "   - Neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "   Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data without any explicit supervision. The goal is to find hidden structures or relationships within the data. Examples of unsupervised learning include:\n",
    "   - Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering)\n",
    "   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "   - Independent Component Analysis (ICA)\n",
    "   - Association rule learning (e.g., Apriori algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?\n",
    "   - AI is the broader concept of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.\n",
    "   - ML is a subset of AI, focusing on algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.\n",
    "   - DL is a specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns from data.\n",
    "   - DS (Data Science) is a multidisciplinary field that uses various techniques, including AI, ML, and statistical methods, to extract insights and knowledge from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?\n",
    "   - Supervised learning uses labeled data, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data, and semi-supervised learning uses a combination of both labeled and unlabeled data.\n",
    "   - In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from input-output pairs, whereas in unsupervised learning, the algorithm learns patterns and structures from input data alone.\n",
    "   - Supervised learning is used for tasks like classification and regression, while unsupervised learning is used for tasks like clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: What is train, test, and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "   - Train set: The portion of the dataset used to train the model.\n",
    "   - Test set: The portion of the dataset used to evaluate the performance of the trained model.\n",
    "   - Validation set: The portion of the dataset used to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "   Splitting the dataset into these subsets helps assess the model's generalization performance, prevent overfitting, and fine-tune model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "   Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying patterns or clusters in data and flagging instances that deviate significantly from those patterns. Techniques such as clustering algorithms or density estimation can be applied to detect anomalies in data where labeled examples of anomalies may be scarce or nonexistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: List down some commonly used supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.\n",
    "   - Supervised learning algorithms:\n",
    "     - Linear regression\n",
    "     - Logistic regression\n",
    "     - Decision trees\n",
