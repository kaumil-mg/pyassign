    "Q1: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data rather than the underlying pattern. This can lead to poor generalization on unseen data, as the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate overfitting, techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, early stopping, and using more data can be employed. Similarly, underfitting can be addressed by increasing the model complexity, adding more features, or using more sophisticated algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Overfitting can be reduced by employing techniques such as regularization, which penalizes overly complex models by adding a regularization term to the loss function. Other methods include cross-validation, early stopping, reducing model complexity, and increasing the size of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. It can happen in scenarios where the model is too constrained or lacks the capacity to learn from the data. Examples include using a linear model for data with non-linear relationships, using a low-order polynomial for data with higher-order relationships, or using a small neural network for complex data.\n",

    "Q4: The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the balance between bias and variance in machine learning models. Bias measures how closely the model's predictions match the true values, while variance measures the variability of the model's predictions. A high bias model tends to underfit the data, while a high variance model tends to overfit the data. Finding the right balance between bias and variance is crucial for achieving optimal model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting include analyzing the model's performance on both the training and test datasets, plotting learning curves, examining the model's performance metrics such as accuracy or loss, and using techniques such as cross-validation. Overfitting is often indicated by a large gap between the training and test performance metrics, while underfitting is indicated by poor performance on both datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Bias and variance are two sources of error in machine learning models. High bias models have simplified assumptions and tend to underfit the data, while high variance models are overly sensitive to noise in the training data and tend to overfit. An example of a high bias model is a linear regression with few features, while an example of a high variance model is a deep neural network trained on a small dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages overly complex models. Common regularization techniques include L1 regularization (Lasso), L2 regularization (Ridge), dropout regularization, and early stopping. These techniques help to control the model's complexity and prevent it from fitting the noise in the data too closely."
