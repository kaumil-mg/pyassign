    "**Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value. It is denoted as F(x) and is defined for all real numbers x. Mathematically, it is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ F(x) = P(X \\leq x) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is the random variable.\n",

    "where x ranges from 1 to 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "CDFs are used to understand the distribution of a random variable and to calculate probabilities associated with that distribution.\n",

    "**Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is widely used to model various phenomena in natural and social sciences. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Heights of individuals in a population\n",
    "2. Scores on standardized tests\n",
    "3. Measurement errors\n",
    "4. Stock market returns\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean. In a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n",
    "- Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.\n",
    "- Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is important because of its mathematical properties and its prevalence in nature and social sciences. Some key reasons for its importance include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many natural processes and phenomena follow a normal distribution, making it a useful model for understanding and analyzing data.\n",
    "2. It simplifies statistical analysis and calculations due to its well-defined shape and properties.\n",
    "3. It serves as the foundation for many statistical methods and hypothesis tests.\n",
    "4. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean tends to be normal, regardless of the distribution of the original data, under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-life examples of normal distribution include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heights of individuals in a population\n",
    "- IQ scores\n",
    "- Blood pressure measurements\n",
    "- Test scores in large populations\n",

    "**Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models a single experiment with two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted as 1) and failure (usually denoted as 0), where the probability of success is denoted by p.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A single toss of a fair coin, where success is getting a head (denoted as 1) and failure is getting a tail (denoted as 0), follows a Bernoulli distribution with p = 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the Bernoulli distribution and the Binomial distribution is that the Bernoulli distribution models a single trial, while the Binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6: Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 in a normal distribution with mean (μ) 50 and standard deviation (σ) 10, we need to calculate the z-score and then find the corresponding probability from the standard normal distribution table or using a calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ Z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ Z = \\frac{(60 - 50)}{10} = 1 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "From the standard normal distribution table or calculator, the probability of Z being greater than 1 is approximately 0.1587. So, the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 is 0.1587.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7: Explain uniform Distribution with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution where all outcomes within a given range are equally likely. It is characterized by a constant probability density function (PDF) over that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Rolling a fair six-sided die. Each face has an equal probability of \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of being rolled, making it a uniform distribution over the range of 1 to 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8: What is the z-score? State the importance of the z-score.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score (or standard score) measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the data set. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ Z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( X \\) is the individual data point,\n",
    "- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the data set, and\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of the z-score lies in its ability to standardize data, allowing comparison of data points from different distributions. It helps identify how far a data point is from the mean relative to the spread of the data set. Z-scores are widely used in statistics for hypothesis testing, outlier detection, and data normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, under certain conditions. These conditions include random sampling, finite variance, and independence of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of the Central Limit Theorem lies in its practical implications for statistical inference. It allows researchers to make inferences about population parameters based on sample statistics, even when the population distribution is unknown or non-normal. The CLT forms the basis for many statistical techniques, such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Sampling: The samples are drawn randomly from the population.\n",
    "2. Finite Variance: The population has a finite variance (i.e., it is not extremely skewed or has infinite variance).\n",
    "3. Independence: The individual observations within each sample are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions ensure that the sampling distribution of the sample mean converges to a normal distribution as the sample size increases, allowing for valid statistical inference."
