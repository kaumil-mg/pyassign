    "Q1: The main difference between a t-test and a z-test lies in the population standard deviation and the sample size. A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and/or the sample size is small, while a z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario for a t-test: A university wants to compare the effectiveness of two different teaching methods on student performance. They conduct a study with two groups of students, each taught using a different method, and compare their exam scores. Since the population standard deviation of exam scores is unknown, and the sample size is relatively small, a t-test would be appropriate to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean exam scores between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario for a z-test: A pharmaceutical company wants to test whether a new drug reduces blood pressure. They have historical data showing the population standard deviation of blood pressure reductions for similar drugs. They conduct a clinical trial with a large sample size and find that the mean reduction in blood pressure is significantly different from zero. In this case, a z-test would be appropriate due to the known population standard deviation and large sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: One-tailed tests and two-tailed tests differ in their hypotheses and the directionality of the significance testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "- One-tailed tests: These tests focus on a specific direction of the relationship or difference. They are used when there is a specific hypothesis about the direction of the effect. For example, testing whether a new drug increases reaction time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Two-tailed tests: These tests examine the possibility of a relationship or difference in both directions. They are used when there is no specific hypothesis about the direction of the effect. For example, testing whether a new teaching method has any effect on exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Type 1 and Type 2 errors are potential errors in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type 1 error: It occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly rejected when it is actually true. This is also known as a false positive. For example, rejecting the null hypothesis that a drug has no effect when it actually doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type 2 error: It occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly accepted when it is actually false. This is also known as a false negative. For example, accepting the null hypothesis that a drug has no effect when it actually does.\n",

    "Q4: Bayes's theorem is a mathematical formula used to calculate the conditional probability of an event occurring, given prior knowledge and new evidence. It is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}}{{P(B)}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred.\n",
    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability of event A occurring.\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\) is the prior probability of event B occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose a factory produces two types of products, A and B. Product A has a defect rate of 10%, while product B has a defect rate of 5%. If a randomly selected product is defective, Bayes's theorem can be used to calculate the probability that it is product A.\n",

    "Q5: A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It provides an estimate of the precision of the sample statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval, you need:\n",
    "- Sample mean (\\( \\bar{x} \\))\n",
    "- Sample standard deviation (\\( s \\))\n",
    "- Sample size (\\( n \\))\n",
    "- Confidence level (typically expressed as a percentage, such as 95% or 99%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's say we want to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the average height of students in a school. We measure the heights of 100 randomly selected students and find that the sample mean height is 65 inches with a sample standard deviation of 3 inches. Using the t-distribution for a 95% confidence level and a sample size of 100, we calculate the confidence interval as \\( \\bar{x} \\pm t \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of the event's probability and new evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample problem:\n",
    "- Prior probability of event A: \\( P(A) = 0.3 \\)\n",
    "- Probability of observing evidence B given event A: \\( P(B|A) = 0.8 \\)\n",
    "- Probability of observing evidence B given not event A: \\( P(B|\\neg A) = 0.2 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}}{{P(B|A) \\times P(A) + P(B|\\neg A) \\times P(\\neg A)}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{{0.8 \\times 0.3}}{{0.8 \\times 0.3 + 0.2 \\times 0.7}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{{0.24}}{{0.24 + 0.14}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) \\approx \\frac{{0.24}}{{0.38}} \\approx 0.6316 \\]\n",

    "Q7: To calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5, we use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = \\bar{x} \\pm z \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",

    "- Sample standard deviation (\\( s \\)) = 5\n",
    "- Sample size (\\( n \\)) = (not provided, assuming 30 for z-score)\n",
    "\n",
    "We find the z-value for a 95% confidence level, which is approximately 1.96. Then we calculate the confidence interval as \\( 50 \\pm 1.96 \\times \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{n}} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the true population mean lies within this interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: The margin of error in a confidence interval is the amount by which the sample statistic may differ from the true population parameter. It represents the range of uncertainty around the sample estimate. The margin of error decreases as the sample size increases because larger samples provide more reliable estimates of the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario: Suppose a polling agency wants to estimate the proportion of voters who support a particular candidate. They conduct two surveys, one with a sample size of 500 and another with a sample size of 1000. The margin of error for the survey with a larger sample size will be smaller, indicating a more precise estimate of the true proportion of voters who support the candidate.\n",

    "Q9: To calculate the z-score for a data point with a value of 75, a population mean of 70, and a population standard deviation of 5, we use the formula:\n",

    "Plugging in the values, we get \\( z = \\frac{{75 - 70}}{{5}} = 1 \\).\n",
