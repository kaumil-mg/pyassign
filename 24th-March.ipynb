    "### Q1. Key Features of the Wine Quality Dataset\n",
    "The wine quality dataset typically contains several features, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Acidity**: Refers to acids that do not evaporate easily. Important for the wine's taste and balance.\n",
    "2. **Volatile Acidity**: Acids that evaporate and contribute to the wine's aroma. High levels can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste.\n",
    "3. **Citric Acid**: Adds freshness and flavor. Acts as a preservative.\n",
    "4. **Residual Sugar**: Amount of sugar remaining after fermentation. Impacts sweetness and can affect the fermentation process.\n",
    "5. **Chlorides**: Salt content, influencing the wine’s taste.\n",
    "6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: Protects wine from oxidation and spoilage.\n",
    "7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Combined amount of free and bound sulfur dioxide.\n",
    "8. **Density**: Related to the alcohol and sugar content. Higher density usually indicates higher sugar levels.\n",
    "9. **pH**: Measure of acidity/basicity. Influences the taste and stability of wine.\n",
    "10. **Sulphates**: Adds to the wine’s taste and acts as a preservative.\n",
    "11. **Alcohol**: Influences the body and flavor of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance in Predicting Quality**:\n",
    "- Acidity, alcohol content, and residual sugar can directly affect the sensory profile and thus the perceived quality of the wine.\n",
    "- Sulfur dioxide levels and pH can impact the preservation and safety of the wine.\n",
    "- Features like chlorides and sulphates affect taste and stability, which are crucial for quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Handling Missing Data in the Wine Quality Dataset\n",
    "**Common Imputation Techniques**:\n",
    "1. **Mean/Median Imputation**:\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Simple and quick. Maintains overall dataset mean/median.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**: Can distort feature distribution and variance, especially if data is not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mode Imputation**:\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Suitable for categorical data.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**: Less effective for numerical data, can create bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**:\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Uses the similarity between observations, can be more accurate.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**: Computationally expensive, sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple Imputation**:\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Provides a more complete dataset by creating multiple imputations.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**: Complex to implement and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Regression Imputation**:\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Uses relationships between variables for more accurate imputation.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**: Assumes linear relationships, can be biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n",
    "\n",
