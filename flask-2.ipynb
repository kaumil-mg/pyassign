    "#Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. GET Method:\n",
    "The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. It retrieves data from the server in the form of a query string appended to the URL. The data is visible to the user in the browser's address bar and can be bookmarked and shared. GET requests should only be used for data retrieval and should not be used to modify data on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. POST Method:\n",
    "The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in the state of the resource. It sends data in the message body of the HTTP request. The data is not visible to the user in the browser's address bar and cannot be bookmarked or shared. POST requests should be used for data modification on the server, such as creating or updating resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2. Why is request used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Request is used in Flask to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) and extract data from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Flask web application, the user interacts with the application through the browser by sending requests to the server. The request contains information such as the URL, HTTP method, and any data that is sent in the request body (for example, form data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask provides a request object that allows developers to access this information and use it to generate a response to send back to the client. The request object provides methods and attributes that allow developers to access and manipulate the incoming request data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a user submits a form on a web page, the data from the form can be accessed through the request object. This data can then be processed by the Flask application and used to generate a response, such as displaying a message on the web page or redirecting the user to a different page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to accessing request data, the request object can also be used to set cookies, headers, and other properties of the response that will be sent back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the request object is a crucial part of Flask's functionality, allowing developers to handle incoming requests and extract the necessary data to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3. Why is redirect() used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, redirect() is used to redirect a client to a different URL. This can be useful in many situations, such as after a form submission, after a successful login, or to handle page not found errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When redirect() is called with a URL as its argument, Flask sends a response to the client with an HTTP status code of 302 (Found) and a Location header set to the URL. This tells the client to make a new request to the specified URL. The client's web browser will automatically follow the redirect and display the new page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates in Flask are files that define the structure and content of web pages in a Flask application. They provide a way to separate the presentation layer (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) from the application logic and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, the Jinja2 templating engine is used to render templates. Jinja2 provides a powerful syntax for inserting dynamic content into HTML pages, such as looping over data, conditionally displaying elements, and using macros to reuse code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The render_template() function in Flask is used to render templates and return them as a response to a client's request. It takes the name of a template file (relative to the application's templates directory) and any variables that should be passed to the template for rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q5. Create a simple API. Use Postman to test it. Attach the screenshot of the output in the Jupyter Notebook."
