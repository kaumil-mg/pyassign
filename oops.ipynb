    "# Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of an object. An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and methods to manipulate that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the class \"Car\". The car has certain attributes like make, model, year, color, and behavior like start, stop, accelerate, brake. These attributes and behaviors can be defined in a class. When a new car is created, it becomes an object of the class \"Car\" and can have its own specific values for attributes."
