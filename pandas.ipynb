    "- head(): This function returns the first n rows of the DataFrame. This is useful when you want to quickly inspect the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- tail(): This function returns the last n rows of the DataFrame. This is useful when you want to quickly inspect the data at the end of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- describe(): This function provides a summary of statistics for each column of the DataFrame, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. This is useful when you want to get a quick overview of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- info(): This function provides a summary of the DataFrame, including the data types of each column and the number of non-null values. This is useful when you want to inspect the data types of the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- drop(): This function removes specified rows or columns from the DataFrame. This is useful when you want to remove unnecessary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- groupby(): This function groups the DataFrame by one or more columns and applies a function to each group. This is useful when you want to aggregate data by some criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- pivot_table(): This function creates a spreadsheet-style pivot table based on the DataFrame. This is useful when you want to summarize data in a tabular format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- fillna(): This function fills in missing values in the DataFrame with specified values. This is useful when you want to handle missing data.\n",
